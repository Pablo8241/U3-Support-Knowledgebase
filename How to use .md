# How to Make a nice looking page with .md files:

- #### First you should note, that we use .md so we can link to other issues by using a       link

- #### Secondly .md offers a very easy way to make nice looking pages very fast.

### To Start with a new page either open a local editor like VS Code or an online one

- The online editor of choice would be [panado](https://pandao.github.io/editor.md/en.html "panado").

### First you should get yourself comfortable with the editor

- To make Headlines press any of the H1 - H6 buttons or write a # before your line of text, important to note is, the more hashtags you add the smaller the text gets.
- To add a link press the Link button on top or `[text](https://link.com "text")` where the text in the brackets is the text the hyperlink is put under.
- To add a picture like  ![Golds smells](https://i.imgur.com/TduEQFn.png "Golds smells") simply click the Image icon on the top and enter the link as the Adress and if you want you can even let the picture link to something by including that in the link box.
To make this without the editor write: `[![links you to google](https://i.imgur.com/TduEQFn.png "links you to google")](http://google.com "links you to google")` this would be the same picture that links you to google.com if you click it
- To write **Bold** simply write two * before and after your word.
- To write ~~Striketrough~~ make two ~ before and after the word.
- To make Bulletpoints simply put a - before the line you are writing.

### If you have more Questions please either google (prefered) or ask khakers for help!
