# Joining a server with crashing problems

###Getting stuck in Queue or having connection problems to a server, 
is mainly caused by having a considerably amount of workshop mods added.

#### To fix the problem follow the steps down below.

1. Open steam, and navigate to the workshop.
2. Write "Unturned" in the search bar, of the workshop.
3. When you're in the workshop, scroll down until you see your Profile logo, and click on the dropdown named "Your files".
4. Then click "Subscribed items". Now you should be able to hover over the mods you have, and unsubscribe to them.

In some cases this method does not work. if so please ask Gamesupport over at the Unturned discord.
